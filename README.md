**Herein lies a collection of odds-and-ends, code samples, and other things which don't warrant a separate repo.**

[midi-text-dump.c](https://github.com/adambduncan/programma-obscura/blob/master/midi-text-dump.c) - This reads MIDI files and prints a text representation to the console. Work in progress. The main purpose of it is to learn the MIDI file format and brush up on C programming. For more info: Wikipedia article on [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI).
